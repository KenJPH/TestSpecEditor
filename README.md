# TestSpecEditor

This contains the source code of an API for TestSpecEditor, a predictive text editor built using Spring Boot for test specifications.
It generates lookahead data given a sequence of words.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to simply BDD by providing a tool to simplify generating test specifications. It was primarily targeted for test frameworks such as Cucumber where test specifications (i.e gherkins) were largely created by either tester or developers. By providing this tool, we hope to involve other participants such as business analysts to help develop test specifications.
